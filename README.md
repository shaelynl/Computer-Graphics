# Computer-Graphics
This is where I store my projects for a Computer Graphics mod I took.
## Lab 1
Make randomly-colored and -sized circles bounce around a 2D-screen.
## Lab 2
Make cars circle around a sphere. 
## Lab 3 
Make the glass table surface reflective. Added a ceiling fan above the table (hand-defined the vertices).
## Lab 4
Used ray-tracing to make multiple images depending on level of reflection and whether it casts shadows.
